When Claude AI first hit the scene, I was excited. With its 100,000-token context length—far beyond ChatGPT’s 4,000-token limit—it seemed like Claude was set to be a real game-changer. But as I started using it, I realized that impressive specs on paper don’t always translate to a great experience.

Despite its potential, Claude’s conversations often fell short. I’d start an interesting discussion, only to have it abruptly cut off after just a few messages, forcing me to start a new conversation thread each time. This constant interruption disrupted the natural flow of conversation and made it feel disjointed. How could something designed to handle so much more falter so quickly? Meanwhile, ChatGPT allowed for much longer, smoother exchanges, making conversations feel more natural and engaging.

Then, there was the daily limit—no more than seven prompts in most cases, as the number could vary, before I was locked out for hours unless I paid for the pro version. As someone who understands the need for a solid business model, I get it. But should it come at the cost of frustrating users right from the start? There are many ways to convert free users to paying customers, and this doesn’t seem like a smart strategy. As a free user, I need to see why I should invest in the platform, not feel burdened by it. Yes, I’ll try it out, but if my initial experience is frustrating, how likely am I to become a recurring customer? Probably not very, especially when I’ve already had a bad experience from the start.

Navigating Claude’s interface added to the frustration. For instance, deleting a conversation should have been simple, yet it required multiple steps. Instead of just clicking "delete," I had to dive into each thread, locate the conversation name, and then find the option to rename or delete it. It felt like a chore for something that should have been straightforward. And while the disappearing sidebar might have seemed like a cool feature, it looked disorganized and made things less convenient. It could have been clearer—it was practically screaming for help.

On the other hand, my experience with ChatGPT was effortless. Conversations flowed naturally, and the interface was so clean and straightforward that I didn’t even have to think about it. Everything just worked. The free version offered so much value that upgrading to the pro version felt like a smart choice, not something I was forced into.

But here’s the thing: Claude is catching up. In some areas, like coding, it’s already showing it can outperform ChatGPT. That’s why it’s so important for Claude to focus on improving the user experience now, while it still has the chance to lead the market. Why wait until users have moved on to something else?

This is where Project Horizon comes in. I took on this side project to explore how Claude could improve its user experience, not just by fixing what’s broken but by rethinking the whole approach. As Claude’s performance gets better, so should the experience of using it. After all, isn’t the ultimate goal to create a tool that people actually enjoy using?

In the rapidly evolving world of AI, having powerful technology isn’t enough. Success isn’t just about what the AI can do; it’s about how it feels to use it. Claude AI has the potential to be a market leader, but it needs to focus on making the user experience as impressive as its technical capabilities. If it does, it won’t just catch up to ChatGPT—it could surpass it.

        <h1>Project Horizon: Redefining Claude AI's User Experience</h1>
        <img src="Claude.jpg" alt="Project Horizon">

        <p>
            Imagine this: a promising new AI enters the scene, rivaling the legendary ChatGPT. I was captivated when Claude AI first launched, eager to see what it could do. The initial interactions? Exciting and full of potential! But as the honeymoon phase ended, the shine started to wear off.
        </p>

        <p>
            My biggest frustration? The <span class="highlight">conversation length limit</span>. Just as we were getting into a groove, bam! I’d hit the ceiling after five or so messages, forcing me to start a new thread. And it didn’t stop there. The daily limit for free users was just as aggravating—seven messages in, and I was locked out for hours, unless I opted for the pro version.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I get it—businesses need to make money. But a <span class="highlight">poor user experience</span> before I even consider paying? That’s a tough sell. It felt like I was being pushed away, not drawn in. The whole process was a barrier, not an invitation to upgrade.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "Why would I subscribe to a service that was already frustrating to use in its free version? A good user experience should draw me in, not push me away."
        </p>

        <p>
            On the flip side, my experience with ChatGPT was like night and day. From the get-go, conversations flowed seamlessly. The interface? <span class="highlight">Clean, intuitive, and downright user-friendly</span>. No arbitrary limits cutting me off mid-thought. The free version was so polished that upgrading to pro felt like a no-brainer. And let me tell you, it was worth every penny.
        </p>

        <p>
            In today’s fast-paced AI landscape, models are evolving at lightning speed. Safety, quality, and reliability are key, but let’s not forget the importance of the <span class="highlight">user experience</span>. It’s not just about having a top-notch AI; the whole package needs to be a joy to use.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enter Project Horizon. Our mission? To take Claude AI from frustrating to fabulous. We overhauled the entire platform, addressing every pain point. From extending conversation limits to streamlining the interface, we set out to create an experience that wouldn’t just meet but blow away user expectations.
