            <h1>Project Horizon: Reimagining Claude AI</h1>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>The Promise and the Reality</h2>
                <p>
                    When Claude AI burst onto the scene with its impressive 100,000-token context length, it promised to revolutionize AI interactions. Compared to ChatGPT's 4,000-token limit, Claude seemed poised to be a game-changer. As an early adopter and AI enthusiast, I was thrilled by the possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as I delved deeper into using Claude, I quickly realized that impressive specifications on paper don't always translate to a great user experience. Despite its vast potential, Claude's conversations often fell short of expectations, revealing a significant gap between its technical capabilities and practical usability.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Identifying the Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    The most glaring issue was the abrupt cutoffs in conversations. I'd initiate an engaging discussion, only to have it terminate unexpectedly after just a few exchanges. This forced me to constantly start new conversation threads, disrupting the natural flow of dialogue and making the entire experience feel disjointed and frustrating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding to this frustration was the daily limit on prompts - typically capped at seven before being locked out for hours. While I understand the need for a sustainable business model, this approach felt counterproductive. As a free user exploring the platform, I needed to see its value before considering an upgrade. Instead, I found myself more annoyed than impressed.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>
                    "In the rapidly evolving world of AI, having powerful technology isn't enough. Success isn't just about what the AI can do; it's about how it feels to use it. Claude AI has the potential to be a market leader, but it needs to focus on making the user experience as impressive as its technical capabilities."

            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Project Horizon: A Vision for Improvement</h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizing both Claude's immense potential and its current limitations, I initiated Project Horizon. This side project is my attempt to reimagine how Claude could enhance its user experience. It's not just about fixing what's broken; it's about rethinking the entire approach to AI interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project Horizon focuses on several key areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improving conversation flow and continuity</li>
                    <li>Redesigning the freemium model to encourage engagement</li>
                    <li>Simplifying the user interface for intuitive navigation</li>
                    <li>Enhancing features like conversation management</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As Claude's AI capabilities continue to grow, the experience of using it should evolve in tandem. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that people not only find useful but genuinely enjoy using.

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>The development of Project Horizon followed a comprehensive design process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Empathize:</strong> We began by understanding the needs and frustrations of Claude AI users through extensive user interviews and surveys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Research and Brainstorming:</strong> We analyzed existing AI platforms, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. This led to brainstorming sessions where we generated innovative ideas to address user pain points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wireframing:</strong> We created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the user journey and core functionalities of the reimagined Claude AI interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design:</strong> High-fidelity designs were developed, focusing on creating a sleek, intuitive interface that prioritizes user experience and seamless AI interaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> We conducted rigorous user testing to refine our designs and ensure they met user needs and expectations.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Throughout this process, we maintained a commitment to consistency in design and natural user flow, ensuring that each feature seamlessly integrates into the overall Claude AI experience.</p>

                            <p>We redesigned the home screen to provide a cleaner, more intuitive interface.

Give everyone access to a solid, capable AI model with no restrictions. Let them really experience what Claude can do. Then, offer even more advanced models and features to paying users. If the free version is already impressive, people will naturally want to upgrade to see what the premium version can do. It's like giving someone a taste of great coffee - they'll likely come back for the premium blend. This way, Claude can grow its user base and boost conversions without leaving a bad taste in anyone's mouth."

                <h2>The Race for AI Dominance</h2>
                <p>
                    Claude is rapidly catching up in the AI race. In some areas, particularly coding, it's already demonstrating superiority over ChatGPT. This progress makes it crucial for Claude to focus on improving its user experience now, while there's still an opportunity to lead the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the fast-paced world of AI, having powerful technology isn't enough. Success hinges on how it feels to use the product. Claude has the potential to be a leader, but it needs to make using it as impressive as its underlying capabilities. By doing so, it won't just catch up to competitors like ChatGPT - it could surpass them entirely.
